<i>â€œYour work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it."</i>

<br />
I am a Deep Learning Performance Engineer (MTS) at  <a
href="https://cerebras.net/" style="color:#FF0000;" target="_blank"> Cerebras Systems</a> working on optimizing the performance of both the pipelined and weight streaming engines on Cerebras wafer-scale AI accelerator.

<br />
Previously, I was working as a Machine Learning Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/ca/" style="color:#FF0000;"
target="_blank">Huawei Technologies R&D, Canada</a> focusing on various model compression (e.g. low-rank tensor decomposition and layer truncation), and knowledge distillation techniques for state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models (e.g. BERT, GPT-2, CPM).

<br />

I have a M.A.Sc. degree in ECE from <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" style="color:#FF0000;" target="_blank"> the University of Toronto</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~moshovos/000/doku.php" style="color:#FF0000;" target="_blank"> Prof. Andreas Moshovos</a> where I was researching the design of efficient hardware accelerators of deep learning training.

<br />

I am a engineer focused on developing efficient computing systems for deep learning
that can unlock unprecedented deep learning performance and make using the state-of-the-art deep learning models
with the ever-increasing complexity feasible for many people. I am also an experienced machine learning
researcher who is interested in model compression and finding new efficient training algorithms. I enjoy
bridging the gap between machine learning and hardware systems - combining my technical knowledge of both fields.


<br />
In my free time, I enjoy running, working out at the gym, or swimming.

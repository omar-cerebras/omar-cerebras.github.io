Here you can find some of the programs I've written.

### Research

* [**Improving ResNet-9 Generalization Trained on Small Datasets**](https://github.com/Omar-Awad/HAET2021_Huawei)<br>
My winning model at the "Hardware Aware Efficient Training" competition at ICLR 2021.
The challenge is to achieve the highest accuracy in
an image classification task given a limited training
time (10 min.). The public dataset for experimentation
is a mini-CIFAR10 with 10 classes,
each has 500 training samples and 100 test samples
of 32Ã—32 pixels RGB images. The evaluation
is performed on mini-ImageNet dataset (hidden
at development time) of size similar to the development
dataset.

* [**Compressed-memory Sparse DNN Inference Acceleration on GPU**](https://github.com/Omar-Awad/SCNN_GPU2)<br>
Compressed-memory sparse DNN inference accelerator on NVIDIA GeForce GTX980, achieving a speedup up to 115x and 170x
on image classification and computational imaging models, respectively compared to an efficient openMP multi-threaded CPU
implementation.
